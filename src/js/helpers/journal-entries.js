    content: 'Greve, Denmark â€“ We are tremendously happy and proud to announce the opening of the brand new Alefarm Brewing.\n\nWe have been on a journey that took nearly a year from finding the right location to getting all equipment installed and running smoothly. It has been quite the ride - fun, challenging and deeply rewarding.\n\nAt the new brewery, we\'ll have a fixed line-up of beers supplemented by seasonal offerings, new releases and collaborations. The production is carried forward by an explorative, creative and spontaneous brewing philosophy.\n\nOur brewing family has embraced two new brewers to help us grow. Having the right people on board is key to succeeding in any business - therefore, we are investing heavily in the people behind the brand. Every single person at Alefarm Brewing is a part of our common story.\n\nI would like to say a profound thank you to everyone involved in the process. Thank you for helping out, for believing in us and for lending an ear.\n\nAlefarm Brewing is the single-most large investment we have made at Tidemann&Co. We have spent millions on all the shiny, new equipment, so opening the doors means the world to us.\n\nGood times await and excellent beers are to be made. We are so excited and look forward to welcoming you to the new brewery. Cheers!',
